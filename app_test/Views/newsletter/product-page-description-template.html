                <h5>Reminder</h5>
                <p>Hall sensors are sensitive to temperature variations, resulting in potential significant changes to the magnetic field of the keyboard during transportation, influenced by temperature and environmental shifts (imagine shipping from California to Maine).</p>
                <p>To optimize your typing experience, we recommend promptly upgrading to the latest firmware upon receiving the keyboard. Additionally, manually calibrate the keyboard through 'About - Maximum Key Travel Calibration - Start Calibration' by gently pressing every key</p>

                <h5>Hall Effect Sensors</h5>
                <p>Ultra-accurate typing experiences adjustable in 0.1mm.</p>
                <p>Applying for the electromagnetic principle, operated by Hall effect sensing.</p>
                <h5>Rapid Trigger (RT)</h5>
                <p>Rapid Trigger removes any delay caused by the physical movement of the switch. Instead of relying on a fixed actuation like conventional mechanical keyboards, it immediately activates and deactivates the key with minimal travel, which is ideal for FPS gaming.</p>

                <h5>Dynamic Keystrokes (DKS)</h5>
                <p>Pressing a key can trigger four different key operations.</p>
                <p>Depending on your keypress force: a light press triggers action 1, a deeper press activates action 2, and releasing the key also supports a two-stage key setting.</p>
                <h5>On-board Memory </h5>
                <p>Settings are stored on the hardware, and there is no need to activate the software in the background.</p>

                <h5>Mod-Tap</h5>
                <p>Mod Tap is a design that provides convenience for gaming. It enables the creation of dedicated or dual-functional keys based on key press behavior.</p>
                <p>A single keypress can achieve two functions: holding down the key for one function, and press the key for another.</p>

                <p>TGL, or Toggle Key, transforms a key into a toggle switch. When you press this switch, you can activate one of two scenarios: either continuously hold down the key/function, or trigger the key/function multiple times at a high frequency.</p>

                <p>The Akko magnetic switches keyboard is hot-swappable and compatible with any 3-pin mechanical switches, providing users with the flexibility to install different switch types according to their personal preferences.</p>
                <p>Reminder: recalibration in the software is necessary after each mechanical or magnetic switch change.</p>

                <h5>Gasket Mount</h5>
                <p>A gasket mount keyboard is a type of mechanical keyboard that uses a gasket material, such as silicone or neoprene, to create a “floating” mount for the switches. The gasket is placed between the plate and the PCB, which allows for a more flexible and cushioned typing experience.</p>
                <p>This design allows for more flex and cushioning, which can result in a softer typing experience.</p>
